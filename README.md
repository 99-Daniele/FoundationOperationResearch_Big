# Foundations of Operation Reserach Project Big

This project involves developing a maximization algorithm to find a solution regarding a real life problem.

The idea was to understand were to locate biogas plant considering the amount of gas produced and shipment cost.

Utilizing Python's MIP library, the objective was to define constraints and optimize the outcomes.

This is the big project, so the evaluation was based on the precision of the results obtained and the runtime, which needed to be under 10 minutes.
